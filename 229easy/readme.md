[The Dottie Number](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3i99w8/20150824_challenge_229_easy_the_dottie_number/)

R. Recursive function that takes any number, just cause.

I wanted to try and not use the built in functions, so I implemented a Taylor series function to calculate cosine which also required implementing factorial and absolute value functions. Just to totally overdo it. Unfortunately, the Taylor series function doesn't work well for values over about 40, so the dottie function also blows up right around there.
