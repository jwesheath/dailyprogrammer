[Reverse Fizz Buzz](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3iimw3/20150826_challenge_229_intermediate_reverse_fizz/)

There are two versions of this solution.  brute.py is a brute force solution that solves the 3 regular input files easily, but breaks on the challenge input.  CLP.py uses constraint logic program and the [Numberjack](http://numberjack.ucc.ie/) library to find a solution for the challenge input.  Also, brute.py was written in Python 3 and CLP.py in Python 2.7, but they'll both work in 2.7.
